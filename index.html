                    Ping pong and table tennis are two different names for the same sport. However, there are some
                    differences between the two. Ping pong is a casual game that is often played in homes and
                    recreational centers. It is played on a smaller table, and the paddles are usually made of wood.
                    Table tennis, on the other hand, is a professional sport that is played on a larger table. The
                    paddles used in table tennis are made of rubber, and the game is played at a much faster pace than
                    ping pong. There are also some differences in the rules of the two games. For example, in ping pong,
                    the serve must bounce once on each side of the table, while in table tennis, the serve can bounce
                    once anywhere on the table.
